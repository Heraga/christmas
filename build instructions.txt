First Build:
-Patch both bps files in the initrom folder.
-Put a copy of Lunar Magic.exe in the LM folder.
-Run the Build From Scratch.bat batch file.
For subsequent builds, you can just run the Build From Scratch.bat file.

The 5 "Insert x" batch files are called by the main Build file, but you can also ran them by themselves to apply changes without rebuilding the entire ROM.

The list files for blocks, sprites, and UberASM are in the same directory as the batch files and the ROM.
The list files for music, sound effects, and sample group file are in the music folder.
To add any patches, you have to edit the Insert Patch.bat file to add another asar.exe call.
