It's totally possible to run custom ASM code in your scripts.[wait][br][sfx 1DF9=A]
[asm=once]LDA #$01
STA $19
RTL[/asm]
See?[wait] We just made Mario big with the following code:[pad left=16][font color=3][br]
LDA #$01[br]
STA $19[br]
RTL[wait][/font color][pad left=8][erase]

The previous code was executed exactly [font color=2]once[/font color], but what if you want to run code [font color=3]every frame[/font color]?[wait][br]
Well...[asm=always]INC $19 : RTL[/asm] It's totally possible :P[wait][br]
In this case we're incrementing $19 every single frame, in other words, it's INCio.[wait][br]
We can make it stop too.[asm=stop][wait][erase][sprite=erase]
[asm=once]STZ $19
LDA #$26
STA $13E0|!addr
RTL[/asm]

There's not much else I can show you about this, pretty much anything is possible with this command.[wait]
I bet this will open even [font color=3]more possibilities[/font color] for dynamic cutscenes.[br]
