<p>PIXI is a tool to insert custom sprites into Super Mario World ROMs.
It assembles using Asar, meaning TRASM sprites are not supported.</p>
<p>Periodically updated Windows (32 and 64 bit), Linux (64 bit) and MacOS (64 bit) builds can be found <a href="https://www.atarismwc.com/pixi_releases">here</a>.</p>
<p>A build for each commit can also be found in the Github CI artifacts <a href="https://github.com/JackTheSpades/SpriteToolSuperDelux/actions">here</a>.
Keep in mind that Github artifacts only last for 60 days, so if you're looking for an older version, you'll have to build it yourself.</p>
<p>If you're a developer looking to contribute to this project, please see the <a href="CONTRIBUTING.html">contribution guide</a>.</p>
<p>If you are using a custom pixi build (read: with modification to either C++ code or asm code), do not report issues here unless you can prove said issues also happen on an unmodified official version of the tool, reported issues that derive from external coding modifications will be ignored and closed.</p>

<h2 id="the-list-file">The List File</h2>
<h3 id="normal-sprites">Normal Sprites</h3>
<p>To let the tool know which sprites you want to insert in which sprite slots, you have to open the file
called "list.txt" or create a new one. In it, you define the sprites you want to insert into your ROM and the sprite
number you want to give them. The format is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>  id SPACE cfg_file
</code></pre>
<p>For example, a "list.txt" that should insert Blue.cfg to sprite number 00, Green.cfg to sprite number 01
and Shooter.cfg to C0 with Generator.cfg at D0 would look as such:</p>
<pre><code>  00 Blue.cfg
  01 Green.cfg
  C0 Shooter.cfg
  D0 Generator.cfg
</code></pre>
<p>Keep in mind that the areas for sprites (00-BF), shooters (C0-CF) and generators (D0-DF) are fixed.
If you want to insert a shooter, it has to be in the range of C0 to CF due to the sprite type's different coding.</p>
<h3 id="per-level-sprites">Per-Level Sprites</h3>
<p>The slots B0 to BF are special, in that if you assign a level to them, they will become per-level sprites. The sprite will only use
the sprite slot between B0 and BF in that one specified level. Meaning you can assign sprite slot B0 of level 105
to a Thwomp and B0 of level 106 to a Hammer Bro if you wanted. Keep in mind this only holds true for slots B0 to BF.
Do note that per-level sprites support at max 4 extra bytes.
The format for per-level sprites looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code>  level COLON id SPACE cfg_file
</code></pre>
<p>Here is an example of a "list.txt" file that inserts Blue.cfg and Green.cfg in the same slots as earlier,
and then inserts Red.cfg and Yellow.cfg only for level 105, while Boo.cfg uses the same slot as Red.cfg but in level 106:</p>
<pre><code>  00 Blue.cfg
  01 Green.cfg

  105:B0 Red.cfg
  105:B1 Yellow.cfg
  106:B0 Boo.cfg
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>  B0 Blue.cfg
  105:B0 Red.cfg
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the above is still perfectly valid, sprite B0 will behave like Blue.asm in any level except for 105, where it will take Red.asm properties and code instead.
This is because since Pixi 1.3, slots B0-BF are not exclusive to per-level sprites anymore but they can be used by normal sprites aswell instead</p>
<h3 id="other-sprite-types">Other sprite types</h3>
<p>PIXI also has the ability to insert other types of sprites, such as cluster, extended, minor extended, bounce, smoke, spinning coin and score sprites.
To insert these other types, you just have to change the list type within your list file. This is simply done by a
type of headline with the all caps type followed by a colon. Valid headlines are: "SPRITE:" (default), "EXTENDED:",
"CLUSTER:", "MINOREXTENDED:", "BOUNCE:", "SMOKE:", "SPINNINGCOIN:", "SCORE:" all without quotes. You probably won't need the SPRITE: header, since it's the default but it's there
anyway.
After that header, you can proceed to place sprites just like before, except they are taken from their respective
directories. An example:</p>
<pre><code>	00 Blue.cfg
	01 Green.cfg

	CLUSTER:
	00 flower.asm
	01 fish.asm

	EXTENDED:
	00 hammer.asm

	SMOKE:
	00 mysmoke.asm
</code></pre>
<p>Note that all sprites except normal sprites use the .asm extension, while normal sprites have .cfg/.json.
Also keep in mind that shooters and generators are part of the SPRITE: group and are seperated by their slot.</p>
<h2 id="sprite-insertion">Sprite Insertion</h2>
<h3 id="opening-pixiexe">Opening pixi.exe</h3>
<p>When opening pixi.exe by double clicking it, a window will open asking you for the location of your Super Mario World ROM.
If the ROM is in the same folder as PIXI, you can simply type in its name, for example "My Hack.smc" and hit enter.
Otherwise, you can use your mouse to drag and drop your ROM into PIXI's window and then hit enter to insert all sprites
specified in the "list.txt" sprite list file explained above.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-command-prompt">Using the Command Prompt</h3>
<p>This option is for slightly more advanced users. To open a command prompt window, hold shift and right click the folder PIXI
is in, then select "Open command window here".</p>
<p>The tool assumes a lot of default paths and files. You can change them when calling the tool from
the command line interface by typing them as in the example below.</p>

<h4>MeiMei:</h4>
<p>meimei is an embedded tool pixi uses to fix sprite data for levels when sprite data size is changed for sprites already in use.</p>
<p>That happens when you have a level that already uses a certain sprite and you change the amount of extra bytes said sprite uses.</p>
<p>Its options are:</p>
<pre><code>  -meimei-off		Shuts down MeiMei completely
  -meimei-a		Enables always remap sprite data
  -meimei-k		Enables keep temp patches files
  -meimei-d		Enables debug for MeiMei patches - I recommend you turn this on if you wanna know what levels were edited and how.
</code></pre>
<p>They are all still considered pixi options by the way, so you would them the as any of ther other options above the MeiMei section.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>pixi.exe -l differentlistfile.txt rom.smc</code> -&gt; will use "differentlistfile.txt" instead of "list.txt"</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>pixi.exe -d -k -l differentlistfile.txt rom.smc</code>	-&gt; will print debug output to the terminal, keep temporary files and use "differentlistfile.txt"</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="features-additions-and-changes">Features, additions and changes</h2>
<p>If you are used to using Romi's SpriteTool, here is a quick rundown of old and new features that PIXI offers:</p>
<h3 id="extra-property-bytes">Extra Property Bytes</h3>
<p>Extra Property Bytes (which are not Extra Bytes, or Extension Bytes, how Lunar Magic calls them), are a feature that was already present in Romi's Spritetool, they represent 2 bytes of data that can be defined in the .cfg/.json file and they will be set globally on that sprites' slot.</p>
<p>This means that if you have a sprite in slot 00 and you set the extra property bytes to 01 02, then every instance of that sprite in the game will have those bytes set to 01 02.</p>
<p>This feature is completely superseded by the Extra Bytes, which are pretty much superior in every way. However, for retro-compatibility purposes, they are still supported.</p>
<p>The second extra property byte ($7FAB34) also holds some extra information for some obscure features in the top 2 bits:</p>
<p>ov------</p>
<p>o: if this bit is set to 1, the sprite will run the MAIN code in any state (e.g. any value of $14C8) and will skip the corresponding vanilla code</p>
<p>v: if this bit is set to 1, the sprite will run both MAIN and vanilla code in any state (e.g. any value of $14C8)</p>
<h3 id="custom-status-handling">Custom status handling</h3>
<p>As most people know, Pixi relies on 2 print statements to tell the game what code to run in which state of the sprite.</p>
<p>Most importantly, state 08 will run whatever code is under the "MAIN" print statement and state 01 will run whatever code is under the "INIT" print statement.</p>
<p>All the other states will run the corresponding vanilla code, however, some bits in !extra_prop_2 can be set to activate certain functions. Setting bit 7 of that byte will make the sprite run its MAIN code in any state and it won't run the vanilla code, setting bit 6 will make it run both vanilla code and the custom MAIN. This is already explained above but repeated for clarity.</p>
<p>Since Pixi 1.2.16 you can have more control over other states that are not 08 and 01 by using new print statements crafted just for the occasion, valid print statements FOR NORMAL CUSTOM SPRITES are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>print "CARRIABLE", pc</code> which will run in state 09</li>
<li><code>print "KICKED", pc</code> which will run in state 0A</li>
<li><code>print "CARRIED", pc</code> which will run in state 0B</li>
<li><code>print "MOUTH", pc</code> which will run in state 07</li>
<li><code>print "GOAL", pc</code> which will run in state 0C</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that while using these print statements, the data bank will be automatically set, so you don't need to manually set it like for MAIN or INIT.</p>
<p>Please be aware that the use of these labels completely and totally overrides ANY vanilla code that would run in the respective states (unless you set the aforementioned bits in the property bytes),
so if you use them you have to code all of the wanted behaviors yourself, this is done on purpose so the code has complete control and they won't have unwanted side-effects due to vanilla code.</p>
<p>You can find the code that vanilla rom uses to handle those states at the following rom locations, you can use those to see how to do implement whatever you feel like vanilla gave you and you're missing now, maybe even better than how the original game did things:</p>
<ul>
<li>$01953C for carriable/stunned</li>
<li>$019913 for kicked</li>
<li>$019F71 for carried</li>
<li>$018157 for goal tape (only activates when the sprite has "turn into a powerup at goal tape" bit on).</li>
</ul>
<p>Fun fact, the game just returns when in Yoshi's Mouth so you can do anything you want here. Be aware that "MOUTH" activates only when the sprite is set to stay in Yoshi's mouth.</p>
<p>If you don't use these print statement your sprite will just run the respective state's vanilla code, just as normal, for retro-compatibility purposes.</p>
<p>There's also another special print statement that works only for EXTENDED sprites, which is print "CAPE", pc and its purpose is to fix a bug with cape interaction with custom extended sprites. You can use it to define the behavior of your extended sprite with cape twirl, not using it will default cape interaction of the extended sprite to do nothing.</p>
<p>Lastly, there's a special print statement:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>print "VERG&lt;version&gt;"</code></li>
</ul>
<p>this is a print which can appear in any sprite type, and it indicates that this sprite should only be inserted with a version of pixi that's at least the one indicated in <code>&lt;version&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> is an hex number indicating a pixi version.</p>
<p>E.g. if you want to make sure the user is using at least pixi 1.31, you can use $31, 0x31 or 31 as <code>&lt;version&gt;</code>. If the version requirement is not met, insertion is aborted.</p>
<h3 id="softcoding">Softcoding</h3>
<p>All the ASM code inserted by the tool is available to be edited by hand in the asm/ folder, namely main.asm.</p>
<p>This means that if you need to hijack or change some code PIXI inserts, you can do it just like you would with
any patch. This is of course mainly intended for people with understanding of ASM.</p>
<h3 id="per-level-sprites">Per-Level Sprites</h3>
<p>As explained in the Usage portion of this readme, sprite slots B0 to BF are per-level sprites, meaning
those same 16 sprite slots can point to different sprite code in different levels.</p>
<p>This can be especially useful for collaboration hacks or for one-off sprites that don't need to occupy
their own global slot, especially if sprite slot space is running low.</p>
<p>Per-level sprites can only use 4 extra bytes.</p>
<p>Per-level sprites have to be enabled with -pl since pixi 1.2.5</p>
<h3 id="sa-1-detection-and-default-labels">SA-1 Detection and Default Labels</h3>
<p>The file asm/sa1defs.asm contains all the necessary defines and macros for coding sprites to
work with and without SA-1. The file will be included by default in any sprite, so you don't have to
manually do that for every sprite you code.</p>
<p>You can check the file out yourself, but the most important bits are the !Base1 and !Base2 defines,
the !SA1 and !SA_1 defines and a define !SprSize for the total amount of sprites. It's either $0C or $16, since SA-1 ROMs have larger sprite table sizes due to allowing more sprites on screen.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are defines for all sprite tables either by address or by name.
To exemplify, the two lines below both refer to the same address:</p>
<pre><code>  LDA !9E,x           ;note that this says !9E, not $9E
  LDA !sprite_num,x
</code></pre>
<h3 id="cfg-files-and-the-new-cfg-editor">CFG Files and the new CFG Editor</h3>
<p>CFG files themselves are mostly unchanged, except for the fact that all sprites will be assembled with Asar,
rendering the final assembler bit that SpriteTool uses to determine whether to use xkas or TRASM unused.</p>
<p>This means that the CFG file format is now:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;type&gt;
&lt;sprite num&gt;
&lt;tweak 0&gt; &lt;tweak 1&gt; &lt;tweak 2&gt; &lt;tweak 3&gt; &lt;tweak 4&gt; &lt;tweak 5&gt;
&lt;prop 0&gt; &lt;prop 1&gt;
&lt;asm file&gt;
&lt;ex. byte count&gt;:&lt;ex. byte count with extra bit&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Pixi will accept cfg files that have the old format with the assembler bit at the end, but it will be ignored since Pixi uses Asar exclusively, however both extra bytes counts will be set to 0.</p>
<p>This also means that the new CFG Editor does not actually come with any new functionality. All the changes in it
are purely cosmetic and meant to make CFG file editing a little easier by giving visual hints for clipping boxes
and the colors in each palette row.</p>
<p>In the two clipping visualizers, the darker color signifies the 16x16 box around the sprite's position (the
position placed in Lunar Magic), while the red dots signify the clipping box' corners.
For those who aren't aware, the Object Clipping (the green box) determines how the sprite interacts with tiles and
objects, while the Sprite Clipping determines how it interacts with other sprites, including Mario.</p>
<p>BONUS: As of version 1.1, you can also open your ROM in the CFG Editor and use it to tweak existing sprites in the
game, basically replicating the functionality of Tweaker. This feature was accidentally disabled in Pixi 1.21 and brought back in 1.41.</p>
<h3 id="json-files">JSON Files</h3>
<p>As of version 1.2, PIXI now aso supports JSON files as an alternative to CFG files (CFG files can still be used
for backwards-compatibility). The JSON format has the advantage of being more human-readable and wide-spread
(there exist a lot of tools and libraries using JSON files).</p>
<p>In the case of PIXI in particular, JSON files, unlike CFG files, embed additional information that can be used by PIXI to automatically generate .ssc, .mwt,
.mw2 and .s16 files for you.</p>
<p>The CFG Editor has also been updated with a graphical user interface inspired by Lunar Magic that lets you edit that embedded information intuitively.</p>
<p>As of Pixi 1.4, JSON files now support the new LM3.30 sprite tooltips features.
It is recommended to use the CFG Editor as the format for the JSON information is quite convoluted.
For the separate appearance based on the extension byte, the following format is used:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">  "DisplayType": "ExByte",
  "Displays": {
      [
      "Value": &lt;value&gt;,
      "Index": &lt;index&gt;
      // the rest of the options are the same as the other display type.
      ]
  }
</code></pre>
<p>For the custom sprite GFX:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">"GFXInfo": [
    {
        "Separate": &lt;bool&gt;,
        "0": &lt;gfx number&gt;,
        "1": &lt;gfx number&gt;,
        "2": &lt;gfx number&gt;,
        "3": &lt;gfx number&gt;,
    }
]
</code></pre>
<p>For more information, refer to the LM manual, section Custom Tooltips for Sprites in the Technical Information.</p>
<h3 id="shared-routines">Shared Routines</h3>
<p>If you have used GPS before, the shared routines in PIXI work exactly like the ones there.</p>
<p>If you haven't, it's easily explained: instead of placing the same globally used routines such as GET_DRAW_INFO
and SUB_OFFSCREEN into every single sprite, thus eating up space unnecessarily, there are now macros to access
them from any sprite without inserting the code again and again.</p>
<p>Check out the routines/ folder for all shared routines included. To use them, call a macro with their file name
in place of where you would usually JSR to them, like this:</p>
<p><code>%GetDrawInfo()</code>
-or-
<code>%Aiming()</code></p>
<p>Starting from Pixi 1.40 you can have subfolders in the routines folder, the routine name will be the combination of the subfolder and the routine asm filename joined together, with no separator:</p>
<pre><code>routines/Bounce/Spawn.asm -&gt; %BounceSpawn()
routines/Spawn/Custom/MySprite.asm -&gt; %SpawnCustomMySprite()
</code></pre>
<h3 id="header-files">Header Files</h3>
<p>Each sprite directory has a <code>_header.asm</code> file within it. This file will be included only with sprites of their
respective type. Unlike sa1def.asm which is included with every sprite.</p>
<p>You can use it to implement defines or macros that have different behavior with different sprite types without having
to name them all differently.</p>
<h3 id="extra-bytes">Extra Bytes</h3>
<p>As of version 1.1, PIXI supports up to four extra bytes per sprite that can be customized via the CFG file and then set by
Lunar Magic when placing a sprite in a level. The CFG file determines how many extra bytes a sprite uses, though
per-level sprites always have all four extra bytes enabled.</p>
<p>WARNING: Be EXTREMELY CAUTIONS with this feature. Changing the number of extra bytes for an already inserted sprite will
corrupt the level data, as Lunar Magic will expect the sprite to be a different size than it is. So make sure to delete all
instances of a sprite before changing it's number.</p>
<p>sa1def.asm provides convenient defines for sprite coders to access all extra bytes:</p>
<pre><code>  !extra_byte_1
  !extra_byte_2
  !extra_byte_3
  !extra_byte_4
</code></pre>
<p>As of version 1.2.10, we now have 3 extra bytes for shooters. Everything that applies for normal sprite extra bytes applies for this.</p>
<pre><code>  !shooter_extra_byte_1
  !shooter_extra_byte_2
  !shooter_extra_byte_3
</code></pre>
<p>Indirect data pointer:</p>
<p>From pixi 1.2.11 onwards, you are allowed to use n extra bytes, both for shooters and sprites - however limited at 12 (not in hex) extra bytes, because lunar magic only allows us to go that far with the input box.</p>
<p>This feature isn't valid for per-level sprites, since by design every per-level sprite would have the same number of extra bytes and allowing 12 bytes for each per-level sprite would break every other sprite that used &lt; 5 extra bytes.</p>
<p>No additional RAM is reserved for this model.</p>
<p>So for sprites from 5 onwards extra bytes, the first 3 extra bytes will be used as an indirect pointer to the sprite data, starting at 1.
For shooters, from 4 onwards, same rule.</p>
<p>Be careful when declaring 10+ extra bytes in the cfg/json format. Cfg format will expect hex numbers, json will expect decimal.</p>
<p>Example for sprites:</p>
<pre><code>  LDA !extra_byte_1,x
  STA $00
  LDA !extra_byte_2,x
  STA $01
  LDA !extra_byte_3,x
  STA $02
  LDY #$0B
  LDA [$00],y
</code></pre>
<p>The code above would read the 12th extra byte for a sprite.</p>
<p>Example for shooters:</p>
<pre><code>  LDA !shooter_extra_byte_1,x
  STA $00
  LDA !shooter_extra_byte_2,x
  STA $01
  LDA !shooter_extra_byte_3,x
  STA $02
  LDY #$07
  LDA [$00],y
</code></pre>
<p>The code above would read the 8th extra byte for a shooter.</p>
<p>So you could say that in this model, extra_byte_4 for sprites is a free table that won't get cleanups. I didn't add more ram for this feature because sprites already have a whole load of RAM reserved and they are mostly unused all the time.
If you in turn think you need more RAM, just extend pixi. Check the section right below this one to see how to do that.</p>
<p>It can potentially be harmful for shooters, since shooters do not possess the same amount of free ram tables as sprites do.
But honestly, I think you should consider if it's really an issue (performance-wise), since to begin with shooters don't even have init pointers, they only have mains.
If even then you think it is a performance issue, extend pixi, add your own reserved RAMs for shooters, add a hijack for cleaning up the tables and be happy.
Check the Extend pixi section right below this to see how to do that.</p>
<h3 id="extend-pixi-extra-defines-and-hijacks">Extend PIXI (extra defines and hijacks)</h3>
<p>From pixi 1.2.11+ we have two folders called ExtraDefines and ExtraHijacks. They used to not come in with pixi by default, but since 1.41 they do.</p>
<p>Folder structure:</p>
<pre><code>  ./asm/ExtraDefines
  ./asm/ExtraHijacks
</code></pre>
<p>They each have their own unique behavior.</p>
<p>For ExtraDefines, whatever .asm files you put in there, will be included in every single sprite as valid defines/macros. So be sure to only use these as defines
and macros.</p>
<p>For ExtraHijacks, before MeiMei runs, this is the last thing inserted to the rom, right after all pixi asms. All .asm files inside this folder will be inserted then.
So be careful with cleaning up stuff, overwriting stuff, clashing with other hijacks and so on.</p>
<p>Combaning those two things you could set up your own sprite/shooters/whatever tables and clean them up wherever you want - so they can be used with your resources.</p>
<p>Essentially, there's no difference from adding a patch to be inserted with your sprite and adding something to the ExtraHijacks folder, except for the
convinience, of course. Please do not abuse this feature.</p>
<p>Since pixi does not touch .asm files, you will have to include sa1def or whatever else defines you defined at ExtraDefines inside your patch, if you wanna use them.</p>
<h3 id="pixi_settingsjson">pixi_settings.json</h3>
<p>Starting from Pixi 1.40 you can have a pixi_settings.json file inside the same folder as the executable file, doing so will make pixi read the file and use it in place of command line options.
e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    "-k": true,
    "-d": true,
    "-a": "C:/Users/user/Desktop/pixi_v1.32/asm",
    "--rom": "base.smc"
}
</code></pre>
<p>Will make Pixi run with the keep temp files option on, the debug logging, with a modified asm path and using the provided rom.</p>
<h3 id="plugin-system">Plugin system</h3>
<p>Starting from version 1.4x Pixi has plugin support. Plugins are dynamic libraries that will get loaded at runtime and can be used to extend PIXI's functionality. Plugins are required to adhere to the C abi.</p>
<p>Plugins are loaded from the plugins/ folder of the current working directory. Pixi will look for all .dll/.so/.dylib files in that folder and try to load them. If a plugin fails to load, Pixi will print an error message and will stop execution.</p>
<p>Plugin order of loading, execution and unloading is <strong>unspecified</strong>.</p>
<p>Pixi will look for 5 hooks in the plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>int pixi_before_patching(void)</code> -&gt; will get called before any modifications to the rom, always runs</li>
<li><code>int pixi_after_patching(void)</code> -&gt; will get called after all modifications to the rom, will only run if there are no errors</li>
<li><code>int pixi_check_version(void)</code> -&gt; returns an int that defines what version of pixi this plugin is targeting</li>
<li><code>int pixi_before_unload(void)</code> -&gt; occurs at plugin unloading, always runs</li>
<li><code>const char* pixi_plugin_error(void)</code> -&gt; used to retrieve error info in case a hook returns a non-zero exit code</li>
</ul>
<p>All hooks are optional and may or may not be defined, Pixi will just ignore them if they don't exist, as such a plugin with no hooks is valid (but useless).</p>
<p>All hooks are expected to take no arguments and return an integer, except for <code>pixi_plugin_error</code> which returns a null terminated <code>const char*</code>. The returned integer is used to determine if the hook was successful or not except for <code>pixi_check_version</code> which uses it as a version number.</p>
<p>An exit code of 0 is assumed to be success, everything else is failure. If a plugin returns an error, Pixi will treat it as fatal and stop execution.</p>
<p>The version number is MAJOR*100+MINOR*10+PATCH, for example 1.32 will be 132 and 1.40 will be 140.</p>
<h3 id="consuming-pixi-as-a-library">Consuming pixi as a library</h3>
<p>Since version 1.41, Pixi can now be built as a dynamic (or static) library to be embedded and used within other applications. The bindings are available for C#, Python and C/C++ in the <code>src/api_bindings/</code> folder.</p>
<p>Building pixi normally via CMake as described in the BUILDING documentation will automatically build both the static and dynamic version of the library.</p>
<p>The documentation for the API offered is embedded as comments in the C binding <code>pixi_api.h</code>.</p>
<p>This will be improved in the future when a proper documentation will be written, but since for now the API is very young and potentially subject to big changes, it'll stay this way for now.</p>
<h2 id="common-errors">Common Errors</h2>
<p>The vast majority of the time, xkas code will work just fine with Asar, the assembler that PIXI uses exclusively.</p>
<p>If you do get errors trying to use a sprite that worked fine in the xkas-based SpriteTool, here are some common sources:</p>
<h3 id="jmp-labelx-or-jsr-labelx">JMP (label,x) or JSR (label,x)</h3>
<p>Asar does not want to guess at the size of these instructions. You will have to append ".w" to the JMP/JSR instruction,
to let Asar know that the pointers are 2 bytes in size (or a "word", hence the "w"). This would look like this corrected:</p>
<p><code>JMP.w (label,x) or JSR.w (label,x)</code></p>
<h3 id="jmp-xxxxxx">JMP $xxxxxx</h3>
<p>xkas accepted the JMP $xxxxxx instruction, despite it technically not existing. JMP is intended to jump to addresses in
the same bank as the instruction, but $xxxxxx (note the 6 bytes) points at an absolute place in the ROM. To fix this,
change it to use the absolute JML command instead, like this:
<code>JML $xxxxxx</code></p>
<h3 id="faulty-math-or-wrong-register-size-inserts-fine-but-crashes-in-game">Faulty Math or Wrong Register size (inserts fine but crashes in-game)</h3>
<p>xkas and Asar handle assembler math a little differently. If your sprite assembles fine but ends up crashing, this will often be the fault of them disagreeing on how to read a bit of math. Asar tries to go the logical route while xkas does its own thing.</p>
<p>If this happens to you, search for occurences of assembler math (such as <code>LDA #$08+05^$FF</code> or <code>LDA #!define&lt;&lt;(!otherdefine\*8)</code>) and specify the register size as before.</p>
<p>Usually this means appending ".b" to the instruction (for example <code>LDA.b #!define&lt;&lt;(!otherdefine\*8)</code>), but in other cases it might also be ".w" or ".l".</p>
<p>Sometimes the math arguments themselves have to be rewritten too, which might be a little harder.</p>
<p>If you can't figure it out yourself due to lack of ASM knowledge, feel free to ask on the SMWCentral forums.</p>
<h3 id="incsrcincbin-file-not-found">incsrc/incbin file not found</h3>
<p>Romi's sprite_tool handled the insertion of sprites slightly differently than PIXI. That is, it created a copy of the sprite in the main directory of the exe and then patched it, whereas PIXI just creates temp file which references the original sprite.</p>
<p>As a result, old sprites that use the incsrc or incbin command had to take the full path to the sprite into accound but PIXI doesn't.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>Romi:
incbin "sprites/data.bin"
PIXI:
incbin "data.bin"
</code></pre>
